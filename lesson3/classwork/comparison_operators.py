# comparison operators compare values and return True or False
print(5 > 3) # Greater than
print(7 < 2) # less than
print(5 >= 5) # Greater than or equal to
print(4 <= 4) # Less than or equal to 
print(7== 7) # Equal to (double equals, not single)
print(5 != 3) # Not equal to

# You can compare variables as well:
a = 10
b = 7
print(a > b)
print a == b)
